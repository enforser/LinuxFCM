# Current Run Instructions

The current version features only the installer. To install, download repository and place it into a folder on the Home drive, then run the install executable.

Running the install feature will download/install nautilus-actions, which enables options to be added to the context menu. It then creates a new file in "home/.local/share/file-manager/actions/" which contains the .desktop file containing the configurations for the actions button. It also places the "ex" executable, which is the program that will be run by the option in the context menu.
